# HealthLens

A personal health data analysis app powered by Groq, OpenRouter, or Anthropic. Upload wearable exports, pathology reports, and health CSVs for evidence-grounded personal health insights.

> ⚕️ **Not medical advice** — for personal reflection only.

## Features

- **Upload anything**: CSV, PDF, JSON, ZIP archives, SQLite .db (Health Connect), plain text
- **9 analysis modes**: Quick summary, deep patterns, clinical review, sleep, movement, HRV/recovery, nutrition, 90-day action plan, period comparison
- **Streaming AI analysis** via Groq, OpenRouter, or Anthropic
- **Follow-up chat**: Ask questions about your data after analysis
- **Download results** as Markdown, JSON evidence bundle, or print/PDF
- **Strava exercise sync** via OAuth, webhook event storage, and optional activity backfill
- **API key stored locally** — never leaves your browser

## One-command automation check

Run the HealthLens doctor whenever you want AI to check the boring plumbing:

```bash
npm run doctor
```

It runs tests/build, checks the live app, verifies the sync endpoint auth boundary, and tests provider keys if these env vars are present:

- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

To also send and clean up one fake production sync row:

```bash
HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET=your_secret_here npm run doctor -- --sync --cleanup
```

The script never prints secret values.

For browser-level dashboard smoke tests:

```bash
npm run test:browser
```

This starts the Vite app with mocked Supabase data and checks the synced dashboard charts on desktop and mobile Chromium.

## Minimal setup path

For the most automated setup, do these once:

1. Add the Vercel environment variables listed below so the deployed app can read/write Supabase safely.
2. Add the same `HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET` to GitHub Actions secrets so the scheduled Doctor workflow can test live sync automatically.
3. Add at least one AI provider key in the web app settings, or add provider keys to GitHub Actions secrets if you want the Doctor workflow to check providers too.

After that, normal updates are: Codex changes code, runs tests/build, pushes to GitHub, and Vercel deploys.

## Deploy on Vercel (recommended)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → New Project → Import your repo
3. Framework: **Vite**
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Output directory: `dist`
6. Deploy — done.

### Environment variables for Supabase

To enable the live Supabase dashboard, configure these Vercel environment variables:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET` (for secure sync and admin cleanup)

### Environment variables for Strava

Strava is treated as an exercise/activity source only. Configure these server-side Vercel variables:

- `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`
- `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `STRAVA_VERIFY_TOKEN`
- `STRAVA_WEBHOOK_CALLBACK_URL` (for example `https://health-lens-rust.vercel.app/api/strava/webhook`)
- `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI` (for example `https://health-lens-rust.vercel.app/api/strava/callback`)
- `STRAVA_SCOPES` (optional, defaults to `read,activity:read`)

After creating the Strava API app, set the callback domain to your Vercel domain, then run:

```bash
npm run strava:webhook:register
```

Useful Strava commands:

```bash
npm run strava:webhook:list
npm run strava:backfill -- --days=90
```

## Supabase live dashboard

The app now reads real synced data from Supabase and includes a Sync Status dashboard section for `daily_health_summary`.

If no synced health rows exist, it shows:

> “No synced health data yet. Use Android HealthLens Sync or manual upload.”

## Strava exercise sync

The Strava connector adds:

- `/api/strava/start` and `/api/strava/callback` for OAuth
- `/api/strava/webhook` for webhook verification/event intake
- `/api/strava/status` for safe dashboard status
- `strava_activities` and `strava_webhook_events` Supabase tables
- idempotent activity mapping into `exercise_sessions` and optional `heart_metrics`

Strava data is labelled as recorded exercise only. HealthLens must not use it as evidence for sleep, HRV baseline, resting HR, respiratory rate, weight, labs, symptoms, or all-day steps.

## Admin endpoint safety

The admin endpoint at `/api/admin/self-test` is secured for system checks and cleanup.
It requires bearer auth via `HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET`, does not expose secrets, and only operates on explicit test imports.

## Android sync app

A minimal Android app lives in `android/HealthLensSync`. It can send a manual fake daily summary to the production sync endpoint and is being extended for real Health Connect reads.

## Fake sync test

Run the built-in fake sync test script locally with the environment variables set:

```bash
HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET=your_secret_here npm run fake-sync
```

To clean up the test rows, use:

```bash
HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET=your_secret_here npm run fake-sync -- --delete-test-data
```

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run build
# Then use gh-pages branch or GitHub Actions to serve /dist
```

## Automation: GitHub Actions

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows to help automate CI, production checks, and optional doc formatting:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs on `push` and `pull_request`, installing dependencies and running lint/test/build steps.
- `.github/workflows/healthlens-doctor.yml` — runs manually or once daily, executing `npm run doctor -- --sync --cleanup` against the live Vercel app. Add the optional repository secrets below to turn on provider checks and production fake-sync checks.
- `.github/workflows/dispatch-apply.yml` — a manually-triggered workflow (`workflow_dispatch`) that runs `.github/scripts/apply_changes.sh` to format docs and commit changes back to `main` when there are updates.
