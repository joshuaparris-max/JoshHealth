# HealthLens

A personal health data analysis app powered by Groq, OpenRouter, or Anthropic. Upload wearable exports, pathology reports, and health CSVs for evidence-grounded personal health insights.

> ⚕️ **Not medical advice** — for personal reflection only.

## Features

- **Upload anything**: CSV, PDF, JSON, ZIP archives, SQLite .db (Health Connect), plain text
- **9 analysis modes**: Quick summary, deep patterns, clinical review, sleep, movement, HRV/recovery, nutrition, 90-day action plan, period comparison
- **Streaming AI analysis** via Groq, OpenRouter, or Anthropic
- **Follow-up chat**: Ask questions about your data after analysis
- **Download results** as Markdown, JSON evidence bundle, or print/PDF
- **API key stored locally** — never leaves your browser

## One-command automation check

Run the HealthLens doctor whenever you want AI to check the boring plumbing:

```bash
npm run doctor
```

It runs tests/build, checks the live app, verifies the sync endpoint auth boundary, and tests provider keys if these env vars are present:

- `GROQ_API_KEY`
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

To also send and clean up one fake production sync row:

```bash
HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET=your_secret_here npm run doctor -- --sync --cleanup
```

The script never prints secret values.

## Minimal setup path

For the most automated setup, do these once:

1. Add the Vercel environment variables listed below so the deployed app can read/write Supabase safely.
2. Add the same `HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET` to GitHub Actions secrets so the scheduled Doctor workflow can test live sync automatically.
3. Add at least one AI provider key in the web app settings, or add provider keys to GitHub Actions secrets if you want the Doctor workflow to check providers too.

After that, normal updates are: Codex changes code, runs tests/build, pushes to GitHub, and Vercel deploys.

## Deploy on Vercel (recommended)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → New Project → Import your repo
3. Framework: **Vite**
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Output directory: `dist`
6. Deploy — done.

### Environment variables for Supabase

To enable the live Supabase dashboard, configure these Vercel environment variables:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET` (for secure sync and admin cleanup)

## Supabase live dashboard

The app now reads real synced data from Supabase and includes a Sync Status/ dashboard section for `daily_health_summary`.

If no synced health rows exist, it shows:

> “No synced health data yet. Use Android HealthLens Sync or manual upload.”

## Admin endpoint safety

The admin endpoint at `/api/admin/self-test` is retained for safe system checks and cleanup only.
It requires bearer auth via `HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET`, does not expose secrets, and only deletes explicit test imports with a safe `test` or `self-test` device ID.

## Android sync app

A minimal Android app lives in `android/HealthLensSync`. It can send a manual fake daily summary to the production sync endpoint. Real Health Connect reads are the next automation step.

## Fake sync test

Run the built-in fake sync test script locally with the environment variables set:

```bash
HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET=your_secret_here npm run fake-sync
```

To clean up the test rows, use:

```bash
HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET=your_secret_here npm run fake-sync -- --delete-test-data
```

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run build
# Then use gh-pages branch or GitHub Actions to serve /dist
```

Or add to `vite.config.js`:
```js
base: '/your-repo-name/'
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173

## How to use

1. Connect Groq, OpenRouter, or Anthropic
2. Upload health data files
3. Select analysis modes
4. Click Analyse
5. Read results, ask follow-up questions in chat

## Supported file types

| Type | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `.db` | Health Connect SQLite export |
| `.csv` | Fitbit, Garmin, wearable exports |
| `.pdf` | Pathology reports, blood tests |
| `.zip` | Withings, Garmin bulk exports |
| `.json` | App exports (Oura, etc.) |
| `.txt/.md` | Notes, reports |

## Tech stack

- React 18 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Groq/OpenRouter/Anthropic AI providers
- sql.js (SQLite in-browser)
- JSZip (ZIP parsing)
- pdfjs-dist (PDF text extraction)
- react-dropzone
- react-markdown

## Privacy

- All file parsing happens in your browser
- Only extracted Data Packs are sent to the AI provider you choose
- API key stored in localStorage — clear browser data to remove it
- Local imports can be cleared from Settings

## Automation: GitHub Actions

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows to help automate CI, production checks, and optional doc formatting:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs on `push` and `pull_request`, installing dependencies and running lint/test/build steps.
- `.github/workflows/healthlens-doctor.yml` — runs manually or once daily, executing `npm run doctor -- --sync --cleanup` against the live Vercel app. Add the optional repository secrets below to turn on provider checks and production fake-sync checks.
- `.github/workflows/dispatch-apply.yml` — a manually-triggered workflow (`workflow_dispatch`) that runs `.github/scripts/apply_changes.sh` to format docs and commit changes back to `main` when there are updates.

Security notes:

- I cannot use or accept Personal Access Tokens pasted into chat. Do not post secrets here.
- To allow the `dispatch-apply` workflow to push commits, the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` is sufficient for commits within the repository. If you need cross-repo access or other scopes, create a fine-scoped PAT and add it to repository secrets as `ACTIONS_PAT`.

Optional repository secrets for the Doctor workflow:

- `HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET` enables the production fake-sync/cleanup check.
- `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` enable live provider health checks.

To run the manual Doctor workflow after you push these files, go to the repository Actions tab, open "HealthLens Doctor" and click "Run workflow".
To run the optional doc formatter, open "Apply Changes (manual)" and click "Run workflow".
