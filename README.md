# Josh Health Analyser

A personal health data analysis app powered by Claude AI. Upload wearable exports, pathology reports, and health CSVs for deep AI-powered insights.

> ⚕️ **Not medical advice** — for personal reflection only.

## Features

- **Upload anything**: CSV, PDF, JSON, ZIP archives, SQLite .db (Health Connect), plain text
- **9 analysis modes**: Quick summary, deep patterns, clinical review, sleep, movement, HRV/recovery, nutrition, 90-day action plan, period comparison
- **Streaming AI analysis** via Claude claude-opus-4-5
- **Follow-up chat**: Ask questions about your data after analysis
- **Download results** as markdown
- **API key stored locally** — never leaves your browser

## Deploy on Vercel (recommended)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → New Project → Import your repo
3. Framework: **Vite**
4. Build command: `npm run build`
5. Output directory: `dist`
6. Deploy — done.

### Environment variables for Supabase

To enable the live Supabase dashboard, configure these Vercel environment variables:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET` (for secure sync and admin cleanup)

## Supabase live dashboard

The app now reads real synced data from Supabase and includes a Sync Status dashboard section for `daily_health_summary`.

If no synced health rows exist, it shows:

> “No synced health data yet. Use Android HealthLens Sync or manual upload.”

## Admin endpoint safety

The admin endpoint at `/api/admin/self-test` is secured for system checks and cleanup.
It requires bearer auth via `HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET`, does not expose secrets, and only operates on explicit test imports.

## Android sync scaffold

A minimal Android scaffold is available in `android/HealthLensSync/` for future Health Connect integration. It includes a manual "Sync now" button and planned data types.

## Fake sync test

Run the built-in fake sync test script locally with the environment variables set:

```bash
HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET=your_secret_here npm run fake-sync
```

To clean up the test rows, use:

```bash
HEALTHLENS_SYNC_SECRET=your_secret_here npm run fake-sync -- --delete-test-data
```

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run build
# Then use gh-pages branch or GitHub Actions to serve /dist
```

npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173

## How to use

1. Enter your [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. Upload health data files
3. Select analysis modes
4. Click Analyse
5. Read results, ask follow-up questions in chat

## Supported file types

| Type | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `.db` | Health Connect SQLite export |
| `.csv` | Fitbit, Garmin, wearable exports |
| `.pdf` | Pathology reports, blood tests |
| `.zip` | Withings, Garmin bulk exports |
| `.json` | App exports (Oura, etc.) |
| `.txt/.md` | Notes, reports |

## Tech stack

- React 18 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Anthropic Claude API (streaming)
- sql.js (SQLite in-browser)
- JSZip (ZIP parsing)
- pdfjs-dist (PDF text extraction)
- react-dropzone
- react-markdown
- Recharts (ready for chart extensions)

## Privacy

- All file parsing happens in your browser
- Only extracted text summaries are sent to Anthropic's API
- API key stored in localStorage — clear browser data to remove it
- No backend, no tracking, no data storage

## Automation: GitHub Actions

This repository includes two GitHub Actions workflows to help automate CI and optional doc formatting:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs on `push` and `pull_request`, installing dependencies and running lint/test/build steps.
- `.github/workflows/dispatch-apply.yml` — a manually-triggered workflow (`workflow_dispatch`) that runs `.github/scripts/apply_changes.sh` to format docs and commit changes back to `main` when there are updates.

Security notes:

- I cannot use or accept Personal Access Tokens pasted into chat. Do not post secrets here.
- To allow the `dispatch-apply` workflow to push commits, the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` is sufficient for commits within the repository. If you need cross-repo access or other scopes, create a fine-scoped PAT and add it to repository secrets as `ACTIONS_PAT`.

To run the manual workflow after you push these files, go to the repository Actions tab, open "Apply Changes (manual)" and click "Run workflow".

Integration docs

See the connector architecture and step-by-step integration guide in `docs/connectors.md` for instructions on linking Fitbit, Withings, Health Connect, Welltory, Sleep as Android and Eufy devices.


## Planned improvements & roadmap

See the full list of proposed improvements and next steps in `docs/improvements.md`.

Key priorities:

- Automated Health Connect importer (first implementation)
- Import preview and history UI
- Privacy controls and encrypted local backups
